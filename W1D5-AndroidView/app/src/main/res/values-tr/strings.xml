In the result list, when you see ViewIt@CatholicU, that means we have access to the electronic copy for the article. Click on ViewIt@CatholicU, the next page will show that item in our SearchBox with a link to the full text.
Google Scholar is good for conducting simple searches across a broad number of databases. For complex or in depth searching we recommend that you search individual subject databases.</string>
